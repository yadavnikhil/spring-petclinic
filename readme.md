# Spring PetClinic Sample Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/)

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/michaelisvy/spring-petclinic-sample-application">See the presentation here</a>

## Running petclinic locally
Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line:


```
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## In case you find a bug/suggested improvement for Spring Petclinic
Our issue tracker is available here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/issues


## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which
gets populated at startup with data. A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
Note that whenever the database type is changed, the app needs to be run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySql.

You could start MySql locally with whatever installer works for your OS, or with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```

## Working with Petclinic in your IDE

### Prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Java 8 or newer.
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Your prefered IDE 
  * Eclipse with the m2e plugin. Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in Help -> About dialog. If m2e is not there, just follow the install process here: http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/
  * [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools) (STS)
  * IntelliJ IDEA

### Steps:

1) On the command line
```
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
```
2) Inside Eclipse or STS
```
File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project
```

Then either build on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or using the Eclipse launcher (right click on project and `Run As -> Maven install`) to generate the css. Run the application main method by right clicking on it and choosing `Run As -> Java Application`.

3) Inside IntelliJ IDEA

In the main menu, choose `File -> Open` and select the Petclinic [pom.xml](pom.xml). Click on the `Open` button.

CSS files are generated from the Maven build. You can either build them on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources`
or right click on the `spring-petclinic` project then `Maven -> Generates sources and Update Folders`.

A run configuration named `PetClinicApplication` should have been created for you if you're using a recent Ultimate
version. Otherwise, run the application by right clicking on the `PetClinicApplication` main class and choosing
`Run 'PetClinicApplication'`.

4) Navigate to Petclinic

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Interesting Spring Petclinic branches and forks

The Spring Petclinic master branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. There are
[quite a few forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) in a special GitHub org
[spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic). If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.


## Interaction with other open source projects

One of the best parts about working on the Spring Petclinic application is that we have the opportunity to work in direct contact with many Open Source projects. We found some bugs/suggested improvements on various topics such as Spring, Spring Data, Bean Validation and even Eclipse! In many cases, they've been fixed/implemented in just a few days.
Here is a list of them:

| Name | Issue |
|------|-------|
| Spring JDBC: simplify usage of NamedParameterJdbcTemplate | [SPR-10256](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10256) and [SPR-10257](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10257) |
| Bean Validation / Hibernate Validator: simplify Maven dependencies and backward compatibility |[HV-790](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-790) and [HV-792](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-792) |
| Spring Data: provide more flexibility when working with JPQL queries | [DATAJPA-292](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/DATAJPA-292) |

# Instructions to run

## Prerequisites
### Jenkins base image
* We are using docker-maven-plugin to build docker images & running docker agent slave in Jenkinsfile pipeline.
* To be able to run above, we need docker client present in Jenkins base image.

+ To build it, use dockerjenkins/Dockerfile
- It uses jenkins/jenkins:lts base image
- Installs docker-ce
- Build by using below command & push to your required repository.

```bash
cd dockerjenkins
docker build -t dockerjenkins .
```

- For reference a built image can be used from below:
```bash
docker pull nikhily/dockerjenkins:latest
```

- This docker image is run with persistent volumes so data persists after restarts of docker container OR EC2 Instance

## AWS Infrastructure Creation
* Create required infrastructure in AWS using CFN template
```bash
aws_cfn/cfn_create.json
```
+ What will it create:
    - VPC with CIDR 172.20.0.0/16
    - 2 Subnets
        - Public with CIDR 172.20.10.0/24
        - Private with CIDR 172.20.20.0/24
    - Route Tables
        - Public associated with Public Subnet
        - Private associated with Private Subnet
    - Internet Gateway
        - Configured in Public Route table for internet access: DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
    - NAT Gateway
        - Created in Public subnet with Public route association
        - Configured in Private Route table for internet access: DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
    - 2 EC2 Instances
        - CICDBox: EC2 Instance in Public subnet with user-data to install docker & run custom dockerjenkins base image
        - Application Intsance: EC2 Instance in Private subnet with user-data to install docker
     - Output
        - Jenkins URL running on CICDBox in format http://<PublicIp>:8080


## Jenkins Configuration
### Firstime Startup Configuration
* Please follow instructions mentioned in its official documentation: https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker
- Login using admin credentials you get in container logs
- Install suggested Plugins - should be enough to run our pipeline

### Job Configuration
+ Add new Item for Pipeline configuration
    - Name: as desired
    - SCM URL: https://github.com/yadavnikhil/spring-petclinic.git
    - Pipeline as below:
    ![image info](./pipeline.JPG)

## Run Build in Jenkins
    - Get sources from github
    - Create docker agent for maven:3-alpine
    - Compile sources
    - Build docker image
    - Run & check docker image starts correctly. Stop when done
    - Push image to dockerhub
